This brief book describes the use of and implementation of a version of miniKanren. It has a lot of the same material as The Reasoned Schemer, but as a tutorial text rather than the Socratic method used in The Reasoned Schemer, which makes it easier to locate information.

Chapter 11 is about logic programming. The description of unification and the accompanying test cases are particularly useful.

**Leon Stirling and Ehud Shapiro. The Art of Prolog (Second Edition), The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA.**
The first section of this book is provides a great overview of logic programming, unification, and the computational model
for logic programming.
